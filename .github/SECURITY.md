# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue. If you believe you've
found a security issue, please contact us directly:

jacob.t.fredericksen@gmail.com

You will be credited as the reporter once a fix is ready to be published. At this time we do not
have a bounty program in place so we are not able to offer monetary rewards for any problems
reported.
